# IMentia
Dementia Assistance Application with Face Recognition

## Project Overview

Dementia greatly affects a person’s memory, particularly their ability to recognize familiar faces and recall past interactions. This capstone project introduces an **application designed to support both dementia patients and the caregivers** who look after them. The system provides real-time assistance by identifying people through a camera and displaying helpful information that aids memory recall. When the app is used to capture the image of a person interacting with the patient, the system retrieves stored details—such as the person’s name, relationship, and previous meeting notes, allowing the patient to better understand and connect with the people around them.

## User-Friendly Interface

A key aspect of the system is its **simple and intuitive interface**, created specifically to accommodate the needs of elderly users and individuals with cognitive impairments. The design avoids clutter and uses large, clear buttons and readable text to ensure accessibility. The interface guides users step-by-step when capturing a face, viewing stored information, or adding new details, minimizing the chance of confusion. This simplicity ensures that the tool remains practical and supportive in real-world daily situations.

## Core Functionality

The application’s main function is to **detect and recognize faces** using a camera operated by the caregiver or, when possible, by the patient. After capturing a face, the system processes the image and compares it with existing records. If the person is already stored, the app immediately **displays their identity** and relationship to the patient, as well as past interactions and meetings. If the face is new, the caregiver or if possible, the patient, can register them by capturing an image, entering their relationship to the patient, and saving their profile for future reference. This ensures that patients receive continuous assistance in recognizing familiar people.

## Conversation and Meeting Tracking

To further support memory assistance, the application **maintains a log of interactions**. Each time a recognized person is detected, caregivers can record notes about the conversation—such as important topics, reminders, or emotional responses. These meeting records are saved in chronological order and can be viewed at any time, helping both the patient and caregiver revisit previous interactions. This feature also helps caregivers monitor patterns in the patient’s behavior and ensure consistent social engagement, as well as provide **assistance in therapies**, such as reminiscence therapy.

## Data Management and Storage

All face profiles, personal information, and meeting histories are **securely stored within the application** using a structured local file system. This enables the app to **function without internet access**, protecting user privacy and ensuring continuous availability. As new individuals are added or meeting logs are updated, the application maintains an organized and easily accessible memory database that caregivers can manage with minimal effort.

# Design Pattern Implementation

The system architecture relies on several core object-oriented design patterns to achieve separation of concerns, flexibility in data handling, and simplified client interaction.

### Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern provides a unified, higher-level interface to a complex subsystem, decoupling the client from implementation details.

| Component | Class | Role and Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Facade** | `PersonRecognitionManager` | Serves as the single entry point for the UI (`MainPanel`). It coordinates complex transactions involving data persistence (`PersonDataManager`), image file operations (`ImageHandler`), and AI processing (`FaceRecognitionService`). |
| **Client** | `ui.MainPanel` | Interacts **only** with the Facade for high-level operations like `registerNewPerson` or `deletePerson`, remaining unaware of file paths, CSV formats, or model training steps. |
| **Subsystems** | `PersonDataManager`, `FaceRecognitionService` | The complex subsystems managed by the Facade. |



# Impact and Significance

The project aims to ease the challenges associated with memory loss by providing caregivers with a tool that enhances recognition and **supports memory reinforcement** for dementia patients and the elderly. By combining face recognition, relationship recall, meeting tracking, and a user-friendly interface, the system improves daily interactions and helps maintain emotional connections. While the application can run on common devices such as smartphones or tablets, its functionalities are well-suited for future implementation on wearable platforms, such as smart glasses. In such a setup, the primary user would be the patient, with caregivers providing assistance when needed. The application empowers caregivers to support patients more effectively while offering patients reassurance and a sense of familiarity. Ultimately, the project delivers a compassionate and practical technological solution that improves the quality of life for individuals affected by dementia and supports those who care for them.
